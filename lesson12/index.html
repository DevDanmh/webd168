        <!-- Basic Introduction -->
        <p class="intro">
          My name is Daniel Hassani. I am a student studying Web Development at
          Mesa Community College. I am passionate about website development and
          programming. I enjoy learning new programming languages and
          frameworks, and I am always looking for opportunities to improve my
          skills. I am currently specializing in the React JavaScript Library.
        </p>

        <!-- My Hobbies -->
        <p>
          In my free time, I like to spend time with my children, family, and
          friends. For outdoor activities I enjoy hiking trails and climbing
          mountains around the San Diego area. Through raising my children I
          have also become passionate about storytelling. I've found that this
          has improved my creativity and made me a better web developer and
          designer.
        </p>

        <!-- Goals -->
        <p>
          I am improving my skills as a web developer with the end goal of
          becoming a full-stack developer. I am taking courses at Mesa Community
          College to learn the skills I need. I am also passionate about website
          accessibility, ensuring all users can access the sites I build.
        </p>

        <h2>Here are some cool facts about capybaras:</h2>
        <div class="capybara-facts-container">
          <img
            src="assets/3.jpg"
            alt="Capybara King"
            class="capybara-img ease-in-opacity"
            width="400"
            height="auto"
          />
          <div>
            <p class="capybara-facts">
              Capybaras are the largest rodents on the planet, and they wear
              that title with a surprising amount of chill. Native to South
              America, these gentle giants can tip the scales at around 150
              pounds and stretch out over four feet long—basically, they’re what
              you'd get if you scaled up a guinea pig and gave it a zen
              personality. Built for both land and water, capybaras are
              semi-aquatic by nature. With webbed feet and eyes set high on
              their heads, they can wade into a pond and hang out just under the
              surface, all while keeping watch like pros. Their diet is pretty
              straightforward—mostly grass and aquatic plants—but their
              digestive system is less conventional. To squeeze every bit of
              nutrition out of their greens, they practice something called
              autocoprophagy, which is a scientific way of saying they re-eat
              their own poop. Yeah. Efficient if nothing else. Capybaras aren’t
              loners either. They live in herds of 10 to 30, communicating with
              a whole catalog of sounds—chirps, barks, whistles, even purrs—each
              one serving a social purpose. What’s more impressive is how well
              they get along with others. Birds perch on them, monkeys hang
              around them, and even predators often seem to give them a pass.
              Their vibe is just that unbothered. In a twist of cultural logic,
              the Catholic Church once declared capybaras to be “fish,” making
              them fair game during Lent. And while that’s a bit odd, it speaks
              to how versatile and widespread these animals have become.
