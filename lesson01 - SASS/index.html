    <!-- Basic Introduction -->
    <p>
      My name is Daniel Hassani. I am a student studying Web Development at Mesa
      Community College. I am passionate about website development and
      programming. I enjoy learning new programming languages and frameworks,
      and I am always looking for opportunities to improve my skills. I am
      currently specializing in the React JavaScript Library.
    </p>

    <!-- My Hobbies -->
    <p>
      In my free time, I like to spend time with my children, family, and
      friends. For outdoor activities I enjoy going hiking through trails and up
      mountains around the San Diego area. Through raising my children I have
      also become passionate about storytelling. I've found that this has
      improved my creativity and this in turn has made me into a better web
      developer and website designer.
    </p>

    <!-- Goals -->
    <p>
      I am improving my skills as a web developer with the end goal of becoming
      a full-stack web developer. I am taking all the courses I can at Mesa
      Community College to learn the skills I need to accomplish this goal. I am
      also passionate about website accessibility and making sure that all users
      can access the websites I create. I believe that resources, information,
      and entertainment is something everyone should have access to and I strive
      to make my website with this in mind.
